# Jingle Bells - A festive notebook :)

This is a fork of James Slack's Christmas notebook available 
[here](https://github.com/jamesaslack/christmas). I fixed dependencies 
and a few minor bugs and included a copy of
[pyknon](https://github.com/kroger/pyknon) that apparently is no longer 
available through pip. This notebook
requires Python 3.2, so it's best run as a Binder (it won't run on the
QM JHub).

Note that I do not support this software in any way!

## Excerpt from the original README.md file:


This is a collective of festive coding activities using Jupyter notebooks written in Python.
The main activity is to use Pyknon to create and play a Midi file to create sections of Jingle bells building together until you can play the entire song.
There are also two additional activities to create a Christmas tree from common keyboard characters and also to use PIL to write Merry Christmas on top of an image. [...]
